### Project Management Dashboard

A modern, sleek task/project management dashboard built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Designed for freelancers and agencies who like to keep their chaos organized â€” with style, brains, and a dash of contextual AI via MCP.

---

### What Makes It Special?

- Smooth, responsive UI with Framer Motion animations
- Full backend integration with Node.js, MySQL, and JWT
- Two powerful MCPs activated:
  - shadcn-ui-server: intelligent context for all shadcn/ui components
  - Framelink Figma MCP: yes, it reads Figma and translates it into code (magic? maybe)

---

### What the Heck is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is like the AIâ€™s brain for your project.
Forget boring autocomplete â€” this thing understands your components. Mention @modal, @card, or @task, and the assistant knows exactly what you're talking about and how to help.

> ðŸ’¡ Think of it as a design partner who doesnâ€™t forget things, doesnâ€™t sleep, and doesnâ€™t mess up component names.

**Endpoints:**

POST   /api/login-user        â†’ Log in  
DELETE /api/logout-account    â†’ End session  
GET    /api/home              â†’ Protected route (JWT required)
```

### Task Management (MongoDB)

PUT    /api/update-task       â†’ Update an existing task  
DELETE /api/delete-task/:id   â†’ Delete task by ID

```

If it works? Of course. If it looks good? Hell yeah.
And yes â€” it speaks MCP.
